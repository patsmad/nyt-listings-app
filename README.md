# BMT + NYT

This is a project born from the general Bad Movie Twins project, but focused on the gathering and curation of New York Times listing data for use in movie analysis.

## BMT

The Bad Movie Twins are a long term bad movie project. We watch a bad movie every week. That's it. See badmovietwins.com for more details.

## The New York Times Listing Project

In order to better analyze what movies we should watch for this bad movie project we started the New York Times Listing Project. This project has several phases.

Phase 1: Automatically gather as many movies as possible from the New York Times listing pages for the 90s as possible
Phase 2: Curate those listing to guarantee the maximum number of movies and validity of the data.
Phase 3: Gather and curate additional data which was not easily gathered in phase 1.

Phase 1 was completed on May 27th, 2023 and at present over 21 thousand unique films across all dates (except one) in the 1990s.

This app is part of phase 2, an effort to make the curation of the gathered data simple and consistent.

## How to use this app

At present you just run the app and it presents a splash page which connected to the BMT backend (https://github.com/patsmad/nyt-listings).

The app uses svelte, vite, and typescript. Running instructed TBD.
